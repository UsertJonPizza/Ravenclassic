Thank you to the Bitcoin and Ravencoin founder and developers. The Ravenclassic project was launched based on the hard work and continuous effort of over 430 Bitcoin developers who made over 14,000 commits by the date of the Ravencoin code fork. We are eternally grateful to you for your diligence in making a secure network and for your support of free and open source software development. The Ravencoin project is built on the foundation you built.

> **Abstract**. Ravenclassic is a meme cryptocurreny based of the Ravencoin codebase. We, the Ravenclassic team, saw an opertunity in meme cryptocurrenies based off the success of Dogecoin. Them memey-ness comes from the fact that Ravenclassic gets rid of the horrible "ASS"et layer created by Ravencoin. Also, Ravenclassic brings to the table the power of **NEVER**, unless absolutly nessicary, hardforking our codebase.
